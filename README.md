snakeAI version 1.0 with some probs
==================================================================================================

 Computing/viewing means installation of snakeAI game with python 
------------------------------------------------------------------
you need pygame library that can be installed using following command

pip install pygame

after you just need to goto location of snake.py module and run following command

python snake.py

contribution :compute and apply a mapping, TDCS (Transcranial direct-current stimulation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
snake can't handle when raspberryposition is not in snake moving direction and crash with wall 

i defined basic function but they basically work that direction is calculated but that don't parse to changedirection variable and over write with whatinput function 

on windows:
------------------------
 on windows it might hard to work with this game but is it okk if get success with windows 
 
 installing pygame library is same as above mention using power shell
	

issues:
---------
